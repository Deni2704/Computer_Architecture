"This repository contains two projects developed as part of the Computer Architecture course, focusing on MIPS processor implementations:
     MIPS Single-Cycle Processor: A MIPS processor implementation that executes instructions in a single clock cycle
     MIPS Pipeline Processor: A pipelined version of the MIPS processor to improve performance"
